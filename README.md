# E-commerce Project (Django + DRF)

This is a basic e-commerce web application built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), designed as a learning project. It includes both traditional Django views and selected API endpoints using DRF with JWT authentication.

### Features
- **User Authentication:** JWT-based login and registration
- **Product Listing:** Products are displayed by category
- **Cart & Orders:** Users can add items to cart and place orders
- **Admin Panel:** Uses Django’s default admin interface for managing products and orders
- **Mixed Views:** Most features are implemented in regular Django views; a portion is also exposed via DRF
- **Permissions:** Basic permissions are applied on the API side
- **Swagger Integration:** API documentation and testing via Swagger
- **Image Uploads:** Product images can be uploaded by admin

This project isn’t a complete product, but it's a strong step toward mastering e-commerce app development with Django and DRF. Future improvements and advanced features will be explored in other projects.
